## Background
When I'm traveling to a new city the typical things I look for are local foods, sights, and shopping areas. I also would like to know the current weather conditions before going out to explore. 

## Use Case
This app uses information from foursquare to display venue information and photos near the location provided in the search. The app also includes current weather information from OpenWeatherMap. 

## User Stories
As a vistor I want to search by a city name in order to find out the weather, food, shops, and sights.
